i want to build a app. and main goal is to fully published on playstore first.

overall plan is, i want to build a travelers live route tracking app where main feature is showing the route marking in live map.

my app features are:

1. most important feature that i want as possible done. user can see there live route on the livetrack section on the app. and that section have, live map preview, and most important thing that i want is that, while showing live route also when user pass all the path after click the start route track button then from that moment all the route that user travel or pass or go though that will marked on the live map or create a another copy where user can see that result after stopping the trackmyroute button  or stop tracking button.

2. group feature, where people join in a group which build or created by the tour organizer or tour guide. where the host person can see all the group member live location in a map and also showing there profile logo into the map (showing live map preview). 

3. individual account feature: user can get the group notification.  checklist because they can confirm that does they missing any important thing to pack for the tour.
